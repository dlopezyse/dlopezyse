Hi! 👋🏻 I'm **Diego**, and I develop Machine Learning solutions that drive innovation and solve real-world challenges. My mission is to bridge research and practical applications to create a meaningful impact.

I'm an Alumnus of Singularity University and a former Data Science for Social Good (DSSG) Fellow at the German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence (DFKI). Currently conducting AI research at Argentina's National Technological University (UTN).
