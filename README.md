Hi! 👋🏻 I'm **Diego**, and I lead AI solutions to address real-world challenges.

I launched the first AI Lab at Argentina's National Technological University (UTN) Haedo, established the first AI department for Moody's in Latin America, and developed AI technologies for the [German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence (DFKI)](https://www.dfki.de/en/web).

My background includes a strong foundation in Machine Learning (MSc), a commitment to responsible AI ([MILA](https://mila.quebec/en) Fellow), and a forward-thinking perspective as a Singularity University alumnus.

**RESEARCH**
- [Drug Repurposing Using Knowledge Graph Embeddings with a Focus on Vector-Borne Diseases: A Model Comparison](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-40942-4_8)

In this paper, we compared seven knowledge graph embedding models (TransE, TransR, TransH, UM, DistMult, RESCAL, and ERMLP) applied to Drug Repurposing Knowledge Graph (DRKG), analyzing their predictive performance over seven different vector-borne diseases (dengue, chagas, malaria, yellow fever, leishmaniasis, filariasis, and schistosomiasis), measuring their embedding quality and external performance against a ground-truth.
